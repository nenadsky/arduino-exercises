# Graduation assignment 4ETR - B6 - LED lighting

## Description

The topic of the assignment is the realization of New Year's LED lighting that will have certain light effects (in this case LED flicker) while the user is enabled to control the brightness intensity in the range from 0 to 100% with two push buttons. Here you will find detailed instructions and explanations of the program. I started with the 6th task from the collection, and there will be more similar texts soon. The practice so far has been to make a video clip and explain the task through text on the blog, and now a document will be available for download.
